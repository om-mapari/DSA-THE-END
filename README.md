## C++ Data Structures and Algorithms
##### This is the code repository for C++ Data Structures and Algorithms. They may be less efficient than the implementation in the standard library.
### Code thoughts & ..
* RECURSION : 
  * Identify : When we have given choices
  * Always call for smaller input
  * Base condition : Think of the smallest valid input
* DP : 
   * When more then 2 Recersion calls then possiblity of DP
   * When maximum, minimum, optimal ans asked the possiblity of DP
   * Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
* BACKTRECKING : 
   * When you are confused, rewind the things and analyse it. How it's solved and then restart your journey.
